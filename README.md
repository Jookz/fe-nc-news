# FE-NC-News

## Introduction

NC-News is a simulated news platform, designed with a backend API that enables programmatic access to application data, and a front end that allows the user to easily and effectively use it. The primary goal is to replicate the structure of a real-world backend service, similar to platforms like Reddit, furnishing essential information to the front-end architecture. This project serves as a demonstration, showcasing the mechanisms involved in creating a functional backend that delivers data to a front-end interface.
